# Scan for vulnerable hosts

Let's scan our DC to see if its vulnerable:
```bash
rpcdump.py @10.0.0.18 | egrep 'MS-RPRN|MS-PAR'
```

# Exploitation

As per the github page this needs the newest impacket version.
In order to get back to the version 0.9 you can use pimpmykali.
=> Probably works with virtual env aswell

1. use msfvenom to create a reverse_tcp DLL
2. host the DLL
3. Run the exploit

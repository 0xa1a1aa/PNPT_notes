Exploiting Samba:
![[Pasted image 20240306075032.png]]
In the output we see that the payload is set to: *linux/x86/meterpreter/reverse_tcp* (staged payload)

In our example we also had to set the LHOST:
![[Pasted image 20240306075252.png]]

Unfortunately this payload does not work:

Stages keep getting send, but the meterpreter sessions also just keep dying.

Set a non-staged payload:
![[Pasted image 20240306075848.png]]

This time the exploit works and the payload is able to establish a reverse shell:

The exploit opened multiple sessions and before we exit we have to close them:

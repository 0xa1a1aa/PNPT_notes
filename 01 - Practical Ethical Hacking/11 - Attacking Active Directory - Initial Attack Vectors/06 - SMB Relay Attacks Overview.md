**Viperone:**
> A SMB relay attack is where an attacker captures a users NTLM hash and relays its to another machine on the network. Masquerading as the user and authenticating against SMB to gain shell or file access.

**TCM blog:**
Requirements for an attack:
- The target must not enforce or enable SMB signing.
- For valuable outcomes, the relayed userâ€™s credentials must have local admin status on the machine.
- You cannot relay credentials to the same machine they were captured from.
- Note: By default, all Windows workstations (non-servers) have SMB signing either disabled or not enforced.
- Another note: Since these credentials undergo relaying, password strength becomes irrelevant.

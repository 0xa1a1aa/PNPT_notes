> Kerberos is a computer-network **authentication protocol** designed to identify each user, who provides a secret password. Kerberos is **used in Active Directory to provide information about the privileges of each user, however it does not perform authorization. It is the responsibility of each service to determine if the user has access to its resources and Kerberos does not validate which resource or service a user can access.**
